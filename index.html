        <p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor 
            which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
             It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.</p>
             <p>The console screen in visual studio code does not allow you to see the code on the screen but it allows you to 
                 see what happens when the code is run </p>
